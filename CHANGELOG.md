=========

## [Unreleased] (1.7.0)
### Added
- New commands: `workflowPermission`, `jobPermission`, `workflowConcurrency`.

## [1.6.1] - 2025-05-18
### Fixed
- Correct reading of command-line arguments when invoked from `.fsx`.

### Changed
- Bump dependencies' versions.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-05-17
### Added
- New command-line option: `regenerate` to prepare a Generaptor script from an already existing YAML workflow.
- New argument for `step`: `usesSpec` to automatically derive action's version from the externally updated YAML (or even use latest available on GitHub).
- New command-line option: `verify` to check that the content of the YAML file corresponds to what would be generated by Generaptor.
- New workflow function `header` to override the generated file header comment (useful for storing license information).

### Changed
- `Actions.prepareChangelog` now uses the new `Auto` version.

## [1.5.0] - 2024-05-16
### Added
- `Commands.step`: new parameter `env` that gets transformed into `env` on the corresponding action step.

## [1.4.0] - 2024-05-15
### Added
- `Commands.step`: new parameter `condition` that gets transformed into `if` on the corresponding action step.

### Added
- `Commands.needs`: support `needs` entry of the job definition.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-03-29
### Changed
- `Actions.createRelease`: update the action to v2, allow overriding the version
- `Actions.uploadArtifacts`: update the action to v4, allow overriding the version

## [1.1.0] - 2024-02-23
### Added
- Better support for execution from `.fsx` files.

  This was technically supported in 1.0.0 already, but from this version, we now support a direct list of arguments from `fsi.CommandLineArgs` as an argument for the `EntryPoint.Process`.

  Thanks to @kant2002 for the contribution!

## [1.0.0] - 2024-02-17
### Added
The initial release of this package. Main features:
- low-level features to set up GitHub action workflows and jobs;
- a set of actions to work with .NET projects, including build, test, and release actions.
